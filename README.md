Walmart Sales Analysis Project
Introduction
This project aims to analyze Walmart's sales data to uncover trends and factors that influence weekly sales. The analysis covers multiple aspects, including weekly sales trends by store, the impact of holidays, correlations with economic factors, and departmental performance. Additionally, the project includes advanced analyses such as seasonal sales trends, future sales forecasting, average basket value analysis, and store clustering.

Project Overview
1. Weekly Sales Trends by Store
We visualized the weekly sales trends for three stores to understand how sales vary over time across different locations.

Objective: Identify weekly sales patterns for individual stores.
Method: Line plot showing weekly sales for selected stores.
Observation: Significant sales variations week-to-week, influenced by promotions, seasons, and specific events.
2. Impact of Holidays on Sales
We compared average weekly sales for weeks with and without holidays to determine the impact of holidays on sales.

Objective: Analyze the effect of holidays on weekly sales.
Method: Boxplot comparing sales during holiday weeks and non-holiday weeks.
Observation: Higher average sales during holiday weeks, though with greater variance.
3. Correlation between Sales and Economic Factors
We explored correlations between weekly sales and economic factors like temperature, fuel price, and unemployment rate.

Objective: Understand how economic factors correlate with sales.
Method: Heatmap showing correlations between sales and selected economic factors.
Observation: Weak correlations indicate a complex combination of factors influencing sales.
4. Departmental Performance
We visualized total sales by department to identify top-performing departments.

Objective: Evaluate departmental performance in terms of total sales.
Method: Bar chart showing total sales for each department.
Observation: Significant sales differences across departments.
5. Seasonal Sales Analysis
We analyzed sales trends across different seasons to understand seasonal variations.

Objective: Identify sales patterns across different seasons.
Method: Bar chart showing average sales for each season.
Observation: Certain seasons exhibit higher average sales, useful for planning strategies.
6. Forecasting Future Sales
Using a linear regression model, we forecasted future sales based on historical data.

Objective: Predict future weekly sales.
Method: Linear regression model and scatter plot of actual vs predicted sales.
Observation: Model accuracy indicated by mean squared error; relationship between actual and predicted sales visualized.
7. Average Basket Value Analysis
We analyzed the average sales per basket by store and department to identify those with the highest values.

Objective: Determine average sales per basket for each store and department.
Method: Bar charts showing average basket values.
Observation: Insights for targeting specific stores and departments with high average basket values.
8. Store Clustering
Using K-means clustering, we identified groups of stores with similar performance.

Objective: Cluster stores based on performance metrics.
Method: Scatter plot showing store clusters.
Observation: Clustering helps identify similar-performing groups for targeted strategies.
Visualizations
All visualizations are included in the repository, providing a clear and comprehensive view of the analyses conducted.

Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into Walmart's sales, highlighting key trends and factors that influence sales performance. These analyses can help in optimizing sales and marketing strategies, making informed business decisions, and identifying opportunities for growth.
